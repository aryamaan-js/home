        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Hello! My name is Aryamaan Goswamy. I'm 12 years old. I know Python and I'm learning JavaScript. I am learning JavaScript because I want to become a full-stack developer. I know the journey is very hard, but since I'm only 12 I have all the time in the world to learn how to code. The lockdown period also helped me with more time.</p>
        
        </div>
        <h4>Fun and weird facts</h4>
        <div class="container">
            <ul>
                <li>My favourite color is yellow rgb(240, 188, 32) but yellow darken-2 works just as fine ;)</li>
                <li>I like cats a lot (cat with ^_^ face is my most used emoji on Instagram)</li>
                <li>I have OCD. I can't stand it when people don't do things the way they are meant to be. Unless it's code. I like to switch things up a bit with code.</li>
                <li>I don't know whether I should do this. Before this, I was learning Machine Learning with Python and one fine day, I was like: You know what? We're doing JavaScript now. I made a second account on GitHub (first account is Aryamaan08) and became more active on StackOverflow.</li>
                <li>I know Small Basic. Do you know what that is? Of course, you don't!</li>
                <li>I have tried to learn many programming languages and was stuck in tutorial purgatory (aka tutorial hell, when you keep learning but you actually don't, because your brain is not excited) for 2 years. I thought it was the key to improvement when it actually wasn't. If I mastered every programming language I tried to learn (tried meaning I looked it up and made a hello world) I would know Python, C, C++, Java, Scratch, HTML and CSS (not a programming language but ok), JavaScript, Ruby, MySQL, R, C#, Small Basic and Go. Probably missed a few. But instead, I know HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Scratch and Small Basic.</li>
                <li>You should follow me on Twitter and Instagram. Okay, that wasn't a fact.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h4>How did I get here?</h4>
        <div class="container">
            <p>My first programming language could be considered as LOGO. I learned it in 4th grade computer class. But, it is possible I learned HTML before that. I tried this Udacity course (which asked for my phone number, something I didn't have) which taught Java (but I never downloaded or tried it). In 2018, I became interested in programming and I took this JavaScript course (Wow! I was doing JavaScript way back then!) but I didn't learn anything. If you had asked me to make any project in that I would have to go back and learn it again. On September 22, 2018, I joined a Scratch class. Till November/December, I learned Scratch. Then I shifted to Python. I was probably the only (or one of two) student learning Python. About a year later, I tried to learn machine learning. Progress was really slow, and I have still not mastered anything in that field. Ask me to make a program that outputs the best regression line and I will say "Sorry, I can't" (maybe I could idk). Then, on Apr 13th, 2020, I came across this web development path and JavaScript free course (by Clever Progammer). I used to watch him way back in 2018. He is from my neighbouring country (was, actually)! Over the course of a week I solidifed my JavaScript fundamentals. I continued to learn web development (with the skills I needeed on a file). And this is how I reached here.</p>
